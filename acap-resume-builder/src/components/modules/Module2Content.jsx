      <h3>4.1 From "Who You Know" to "Who You Can Know": Network Mapping</h3>
      <p>The module begins by directly challenging a common and often debilitating schema: the belief that "networking is only for people who are already well-connected." To dismantle this limiting belief, the first activity is Network Mapping. Learners are introduced to a simple, interactive online tool that guides them to visually map their existing network. <em>[Note: This is a reflective exercise. An interactive tool will be available in a future version.]</em> The prompts encourage a broad definition of "network," including family members, friends, neighbors, former colleagues, members of community or faith groups, and even local business owners they know. This active, visual exercise helps learners construct a new and more expansive understanding of their own social capital. By seeing their connections laid out before them, they realize they are far more connected than they initially believed, which provides an immediate boost in confidence and a tangible starting point for their networking efforts.</p>

      <h3>4.2 Scaffolding the Interaction: Crafting the Informational Interview Request</h3>
      <p>Recognizing the high level of anxiety many people feel about reaching out to strangers, the process of initiating contact is carefully scaffolded. Learners are not simply told to "go network." Instead, they are presented with an authentic, low-stakes problem: "You have identified a company in Aroostook County that interests you, but they have no jobs posted. Your goal is to learn more about the company culture and potential future opportunities. Using the provided templates, draft a concise and professional email to an employee at that company requesting a 15-minute informational interview".</p>
      <p>The website provides several templates that learners can adapt, reducing the initial barrier of staring at a blank page. After drafting their email, they post it to the community forum for peer feedback. <em>[Note: The <a href="/forum">Community Forum</a> is available for these discussions. Full interactive features are under development.]</em> Fellow participants can offer suggestions for improvement in a supportive environment. This collaborative process serves multiple purposes: it demystifies the task, normalizes the activity of reaching out, and allows learners to refine and perfect their approach in a safe, simulated environment before they ever click "send" on a real email.</p>

      <h3>4.3 Rehearsal for Reality: The Simulated Networking Event</h3>
      <p>This activity is a key constructivist exercise designed to provide practical, hands-on experience in a controlled setting. A scenario is posted in a dedicated discussion forum: "Welcome to the Aroostook County Virtual Career Fair. In the thread below, please post a brief (3-4 sentence) 'elevator pitch' introducing yourself and your professional interests. Then, review the introductions from at least two of your peers and ask each of them one thoughtful question about their background or career goals.". <em>[Note: Please use the "Simulated Networking Event" topic in the <a href="/forum">Community Forum</a> for this activity.]</em> This simulation allows learners to practice articulating their value proposition and engaging in the kind of reciprocal questioning that is central to effective networking. The asynchronous nature of the forum lowers the pressure compared to a live event, giving participants time to formulate their thoughts. This active, social participation builds conversational skills and confidence, preparing them for real-world networking opportunities.</p>

      <h3>4.4 Yin Integration: Normalizing Networking Anxiety</h3>
      <p>This module explicitly integrates a "Yin" component to address the significant fear and anxiety often associated with networking. Rather than treating this anxiety as a personal failing, the curriculum normalizes it as a common and understandable reaction. This is achieved through two methods. First, the module includes a short, downloadable audio guide titled "Managing Social Anxiety in Professional Settings," which offers practical, evidence-based techniques. Second, and more importantly, a forum discussion is initiated with the prompt: "What is your single biggest fear or concern about networking? After posting your own fear, read through the responses from your peers. What is one piece of advice or encouragement you can offer to someone else?" This activity leverages the power of social constructivism. By sharing their vulnerabilities and co-constructing coping strategies, learners realize they are not alone in their fears. This shared experience is often more powerful and validating than a simple list of expert tips, fostering a sense of community and mutual support.</p>
